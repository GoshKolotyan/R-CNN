# R-CNN Fine-Tuning Project

Fine-tuning various R-CNN and segmentation models with custom datasets using PyTorch Lightning.

## Project Goal

This project aims to fine-tune segmentation-based models using PyTorch Lightning framework. We implement and compare performance across different model architectures ranging from simple to complex models.

## Model Architecture

### Simple Models
- **R-CNN** - Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks
- **U-Net** - Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
- **DeepLab** - Deep Labeling for Semantic Image Segmentation
- **FCN** - Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation

### Advanced Models
- **Mask2Former + Detectron2** - Universal Image Segmentation
- **YOLO** - You Only Look Once object detection
- **Mask R-CNN** - Instance segmentation extension of Faster R-CNN
- **SegFormer** - Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation
